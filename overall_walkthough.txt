###############################
### male_female_comparisons ###
###############################

Follow data processing steps in male_female_comparisons_walkthough.txt

Prepare fold coverage differences using bedtools_depth.R

Prepare and explore all window data using window_figures.R

################################
########## gene_trees ##########
################################

#--- pre_Y_inference

Follow data processing steps in gene_trees_walkthough.txt

use y_consistent_trees.R to assess if gene trees are consistent with sex chromosomes

#----- Y_inference

Follow data processing steps in y_assignment_trees.txt
	major product is a new vcf chrXII_pun_Ylabeled.vcf, with Y haplotypes labeled for males
	merge this back together with other phased data for downstream analyses with Y haplotypes

Run twisst on the gene trees from chr12 with 


#################################
######### introgression #########
#################################

follow steps in introgression_walkthough.txt

plot PCA results with plot_pcas.R

plot admixture results with plot_admixture.R

plot fd statstics with plot_ABBA_BABA.R

plot distance stats with plot_distance.R

plot big multipanel line plot with plot_genomic_windows.R

#--- full_genome_admixture

this was done based on reviewer comments so was kept separately

instructions to build input files can be found in introgression_walkthrough.txt

analyze them with full_genome_admixture.R


##################################
########## degeneration ##########
##################################

follow steps in degeneration_walkthrough.txt

analyze repetitive element differences with repetitive_element_deseq.R

analyze dnds differences with compare_pairwise_dnds.R

analyze provean scores with plot_provean.R

#--- full_genome_dS:

this was added based on reviewer comments

follow dnds_all_chroms.txt

analyze with full_dS.R

###################################
######### gene expression #########
###################################

#--- baseline expression
get standard gene fold counts using bowtie --local by following gene_expression_walkthrough.txt

clean and prep White data with intialize_basicAlignment_counts.R   

get ancestral and male:female expression differences with deseqBaseline_white.R

get male:female expression differences for von Hippel dataset with deseqBaseline_vonHippel.R                    

get DNA fold differences for controlling for mapping efficiency with deseqBaseline_DNA.R                          

replicate 3-spine degeneration results with deseqBaseline_replicate_white_degeneration.R #(this was not included in paper)


#--- calling Y-linked
get VCFs from RNA data and run vcfwrapper by following gene_expression_walkthrough.txt

use call_rna_ylinked0.R to estimate false discovery rates and pick optimal frequency/heterozygosity (picked 0 in females and 0.8 het in males)

use call_rna_ylinked.R to output the files needed for SNPsplit

use plot_RNA_vcfwrap.R to plot figure 1 equivalents from the RNA data


#--- allele-specific expression
run SNPsnplit by following gene_expression_walkthrough.txt

compare X and Y counts for the White dataset with xy_white_deseq.R

same for von Hippel with xy_vonHippel_deseq.R

#--- synthesis

to gather everything together, use figure7_exploratory.R
